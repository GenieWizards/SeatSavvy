## Types package

- Create separate file based on feature (Eg: user.ts, product.ts, etc..,)
- Use Zod to create type schemas and infer type from the created schema
- Build the package and then import it in frontend or backend from '@seatsavvy/types'

**NOTE**: Both in API and WEB apps I have included this package
